# Life-Insurance-Application-Use-Case

Description
As a business analyst, I crafted a detailed use case for an online life insurance application portal, addressing the needs of applicants seeking personalized coverage. The use case captures the end-to-end process, from entering personal details (e.g., name, age, contact information) and medical history to selecting term plans and optional coverages based on strict eligibility rules. For instance, applicants aged 50–60 are offered 10- or 20-year terms, while those under 50 or exactly 60 are limited to 10-year terms, and those 65 or older are ineligible. Coverage amounts were clearly defined (e.g., $2,300–$1M for 20-year terms; $2,500–$2M for 10-year terms), with optional coverages like disability distribution restricted to applicants under 60.
The use case is structured with a primary flow for the standard application process, alternate flows for editing or canceling applications, and exceptional flows for error scenarios (e.g., invalid inputs, system errors). This structure ensures clarity for developers implementing the system and testers designing validation scenarios. Leveraging my expertise in business analysis, I incorporated precise logic for age-based eligibility and conditional coverage display, aligning with stakeholder requirements.
This project showcases my ability to create user-centric documentation that bridges business needs and technical implementation. By anticipating edge cases (e.g., existing customers with prior coverage) and defining clear error messages, the use case supports seamless UI/UX design and system reliability. My familiarity with tools like SQL informed assumptions about data storage, while my experience with Canva inspired recommendations for visual aids like flowcharts to enhance stakeholder understanding. This deliverable reflects my commitment to delivering structured, high-quality documentation that drives efficient development and enhances user experience.
